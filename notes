Program no: 3

This is the program where we are using strategy design pattern.
 1) Favor composition over inheritance
 2) Always design to interfaces, never code to concrete classes
 3) our code should be open for extension and closed for modification
 
 In this program we are fully using all the above three rules of Strategy Design Pattern.
